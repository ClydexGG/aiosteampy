# Client Classes

The aiosteampy library provides several client classes for interacting with the Steam API. 
Each client class has specific responsibilities and capabilities.

## Client Classes and Their Responsibilities

### SteamPublicClient

The `SteamPublicClient` class provides methods that don't require authentication. 
It's useful for accessing public Steam data like market listings, user inventories, and price information.

```python
from aiosteampy import SteamPublicClient, App

client = SteamPublicClient()

# Get market listings for an item
listings, total_count, last_modified = await client.get_item_listings("AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)", App.CS2)

# Get item orders histogram
item_name_id = await client.get_item_name_id("Revolution Case", App.CS2)
histogram, last_modified = await client.get_item_orders_histogram(item_name_id)
```

See the [Public API Methods](./public.md) page for more details on available methods.

### SteamClient

The `SteamClient` class is the main client for authenticated interactions with Steam. 
It inherits from `SteamPublicClient` and includes **all the functionality from mixins listed below**.

```python
from aiosteampy import SteamClient, Currency, AppContext

client = SteamClient(
    steam_id=76561198012345678,  # steam id(64) or account id(32)
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    shared_secret="your_shared_secret",
    identity_secret="your_identity_secret",  # optional, required for confirmations
    api_key="your_api_key",  # optional
    trade_token="your_trade_token",  # optional
    wallet_currency=Currency.UAH,  # optional
    wallet_country="UA",  # optional
)

# Login to Steam
await client.login()

# Prepare the client (get trade token, API key, etc.)
await client.prepare(api_key_domain="your-domain.com")

# Access your inventory
inventory, total_count, last_asset_id = await client.get_inventory(AppContext.CS2)

# Place a market listing
item = await client.get_inventory_item(AppContext.CS2, asset_id=1234567890)
listing_id = await client.place_sell_listing(item, price=10000)  # price in cents
```

## Initialization and Login

To prevent additional requests to Steam when logging in, you can pass all known data to the init method:

```python
from aiosteampy import SteamClient, Currency, Language

client = SteamClient(
    steam_id=76561198012345678,  # steam id(64) or account id(32)
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    shared_secret="your_shared_secret",
    identity_secret="your_identity_secret",  # optional, required for confirmations
    api_key="your_api_key",  # optional
    trade_token="your_trade_token",  # optional
    wallet_currency=Currency.UAH,  # optional
    wallet_country="UA",  # optional
    language=Language.ENGLISH,  # optional
    tz_offset="0,0",  # optional
)

await client.login()
```

!!! note "API Key Not Required"
    Since the end of March 2024, an API key is not required to access the Steam Web API. Users can freely use the 
    full functionality of the library without an API key.

### Preparing the Client

The `prepare()` method prepares the client by loading main attributes (trade token, currency, country) from Steam. 
It also ensures privacy settings are set correctly for inventory and related features.

```python
# Prepare the client (get trade token, set privacy settings, etc.)
await client.prepare()

# If you want to register an API key (optional)
await client.prepare(api_key_domain="your-domain.com")
```

When using the `prepare()` method with an `api_key_domain` parameter, an API key will be automatically registered 
for that domain if one doesn't exist. It is highly recommended to register the API key on a domain that you control.

### Additional Parameters

The client initialization accepts several additional parameters:

* `language` - Language for Steam responses (default: `Language.ENGLISH`)
* `tz_offset` - Timezone offset string that will be set as a cookie value (default: `"10800,0"`)
* `session` - Custom [aiohttp.ClientSession](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#client-session)
* `proxy` - Proxy URL as a string (e.g., `"http://username:password@host:port"`)
* `user_agent` - Custom User-Agent header value

!!! warning "Session Configuration"
    If you create a custom session, `raise_for_status` must be set to `True`: 
    `ClientSession(..., raise_for_status=True)`. Otherwise, errors will not be handled correctly, which can cause 
    unexpected behavior.

## Mixins and Their Functionality

The client classes use several mixins to provide different functionality:

## Custom Client Implementation

If you need to create a custom client with specific functionality, you can subclass `SteamClientBase` or 
`SteamPublicClientBase`:

```python
from aiosteampy.client import SteamClientBase

class MyCustomClient(SteamClientBase):
    __slots__ = (
        *SteamClientBase.SLOTS,
        "custom_attribute",  # your custom attributes
    )

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.custom_attribute = "custom value"

    async def custom_method(self):
        # Your custom implementation
        pass
```

If you need to use multiple inheritance with `__slots__`, make sure to include all the necessary slots:

```python
from aiosteampy.client import SteamClientBase, SteamClient

from some_other_library import SomeOtherClass

class MyClient(SteamClientBase, SomeOtherClass):
    __slots__ = (
        *SteamClientBase.SLOTS,
        *SomeOtherClass.__slots__,
        "custom_attribute",  # your custom attributes
    )

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Your custom initialization
```
